- fetch per 20 results, max 5 streams at a time
- all results are sorted in a table by timestamp (order which it comes is not important since multiple streams can result diff results)
- load older (on bottom) fetches "next 5 streams", if there is none, listStreams with token
- load newer (on top) lists new streams and new logevents
- active streams are defined by last logs in a stream (if in last 10 minutes)
